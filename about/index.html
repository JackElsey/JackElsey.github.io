			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am an environmental engineer committed to the challenge of cleaning up China's hazardous waste sites. After working in the US and China for a few years, I've decided to pursue a PhD at Tufts University related to remediation and environmental fate/transport.

<p>
In my free time I enjoy reading, studying Mandarin Chinese, and gardening.

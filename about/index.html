	<p>I am an environmental engineer committed to the challenge of cleaning up China's hazardous waste sites. After working in the US and China for a few years, I've decided to pursue a PhD at Tufts University related to remediation and environmental fate/transport.

	In my free time I enjoy learning Chinese, weightlifting, and <a href="https://lichess.org/@/bu_zhi_suo_cuo">losing at chess</a>.

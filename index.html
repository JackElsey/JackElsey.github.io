<h1>Jack Elsey</h1>

<p>I'm an engineer specializing in developing models and linking them to the real world with statistics. After working in the US and Chinese environmental remediation industry for a few years, I decided to pursue a PhD at Tufts University. I recently graduated and am looking for my next opportunity.</p>

From a <a href="https://megamandarin.com/?product=practical-cursive-flashcard-deck">product I sell for learning cursive Chinese</a>. I used computer vision techniques to precisely split hours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jeyd490_Fqs">video footage</a> into thousands of stroke order animations.</p>

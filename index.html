<h1>Jack Elsey</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm a graduate student at <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/">Tufts University</a> pursuing a PhD in environmental and water resources engineering. I've previously worked as an environmental remediation engineer in the US and China.</p>
	
<p>For my dissertation I am primarily researching best practices for fitting microbial bioremediation models to laboratory experiments. When I finish my PhD sometime this year I hope to find work in the environmental consulting industry.</p>

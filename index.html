<h1>Jack Elsey</h1>

<p>I am an environmental engineer specializing in developing models and linking them to the real world with statistics. After working in the US and China for a few years, I decided to pursue a PhD at Tufts University related to remediation and environmental fate/transport. I recently graduated and am looking for my next opportunity.</p>

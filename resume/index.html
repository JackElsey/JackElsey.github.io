<h1 id="research-experience-and-publications">Research Experience and Publications</h1>
<p><strong>Subsurface Source Zone Characterization and Uncertainty Quantification Using Discriminative Random Fields</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026481">link</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisted paper authors by debugging code and running subsurface multiphase contaminant transport models to generate synthetic training data.</li>
<li>A machine learning model was trained to use soil boring data for predictions of where denser-than-water contaminants had pooled in the subsurface.</li>
<li>Wrote dissertation proposal to expand the model&#39;s prediction capability from 2D to 3D, but proposal failed to get funding because research priorities were transitioning to PFAS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exploration of Processes Governing Microbial Reductive Dechlorination in a Heterogeneous Aquifer Flow Cell</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.116842">link</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote numerical model describing the microbially mediated degradation of contaminants in laboratory treatability tests.</li>
<li>Estimated kinetic parameters of degradation process by fitting model to experimental data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Microbial Reductive Dechlorination by a Commercially Available Dechlorinating Consortium Is Not Inhibited by Perfluoroalkyl Acids at Field-Relevant Concentrations</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c04815">link</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fit microbial model to laboratory experiments designed to measure how the presence of PFAS can slow the degradation of other subsurface contaminants.</li>
<li>Used a superposition of an analytical solution to the diffusion equation to refine predictions of experimental mass loss.</li>
<li>Extremely ill-posed nature of inverse problem resulted in large computing resource requirements for model-fitting optimization, so I used a free trial of Google Cloud to quickly complete the parameter estimation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quantifying Impacts of Microcosm Mass Loss on Kinetic Constant Estimation</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03452">link</a>) <em>first author</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Summarized 20+ studies of microbially mediated contaminant degradation to illustrate how incidental mass loss of contaminants from laboratory equipment was common but also routinely excluded from the numerical models used to estimate parameters.</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/">WebPlotDigitizer</a> to extract plotted concentration measurements from studies that did not share mass loss estimates.</li>
<li>Conducted Monte Carlo experiment to demonstrate that excluding mass loss from the numerical model frequently resulted in biased kinetic parameter estimates.</li>
<li>Shared results via <a href="https://jackelsey.com/assets/documents/Jack%20Elsey%20RemTEC%202021%20poster.pdf">poster</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/xbGhFZ8WN38">flash presentation</a> at 2021 RemTEC Summit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On the Reliable Estimation of Sequential Monod Kinetic Parameters</strong> (in review) <em>first author</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Used Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to randomly select sets of microbial degradation kinetic parameters that result in realistic synthetic datasets.</li>
<li>Performed Monte Carlo experiment with more than a million individual model fittings to measure accuracy and precision of parameter estimates derived from different types of laboratory treatability test designs.</li>
<li>Implemented likelihood-ratio test to show that a commonly used treatability test design will usually result in failure to uniquely estimate subsets of the kinetic parameters.</li>
<li>Demonstrated that ill-posed nature of inverse problem can be largely attributed to extreme collinearity of model fitting results.</li>
<li>Compared nonlinear regression analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo to determine which method results in more reliable interval estimates of kinetic parameters.</li>
<li>Computational resources required for the various Monte Carlo experiments greatly exceeded what could feasibly be performed on the Tufts HPC cluster with my user privileges, so I adapted the code to run on a disused computer cluster originally purchased by the Geology Department in 2009.</li>
